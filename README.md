# About the Project
We envisioned an intelligent companion for new parentsâ€”one that transforms scattered baby care logs into meaningful, real-time insights. With Beebi, we aim to relieve the cognitive load of early parenting by replacing static charts with conversational, AI-powered summaries. This vision redefines baby tracking as not just data collection, but a proactive, supportive experience that empowers parents to understand and respond to their baby's needs with clarity and confidence.
